1. **Fiscal Deficit and Revenue Shortfalls:** A GST reduction in 2025 would severely undermine government revenue, risking budget deficits and forcing austerity measures (e.g., cuts to public healthcare, education, infrastructure). This could negate any temporary consumer benefits by degrading essential services that disproportionately support low-income households. For instance, IMF studies show that VAT/GST cuts in emerging economies often lead to unsustainable debt levels, requiring compensatory tax hikes elsewhere.

2. **Inflationary Risks and Supply-Side Limitations:** While lower GST might temporarily curb prices, it could fuel demand-pull inflation if consumer spending outpaces supply capacity—particularly in sectors like food and utilities. Moreover, businesses may retain savings rather than pass them to consumers, as evidenced by India’s 2017 GST rollout, where compliance costs initially led to price hikes despite rate reductions.

3. **Undermining Business Innovation and Competitiveness:** Reduced GST could disincentivize productivity-driven growth, encouraging businesses to rely on cost-cutting instead of innovation. MSMEs, in particular, may face higher compliance burdens adapting to frequent rate changes, stifling scalability. Historical precedents (e.g., Brazil’s IPI tax cuts) reveal that such policies often fail to spur long-term competitiveness without parallel investment in R&D.

4. **Erosion of Tax Base and Compliance Incentives:** Lower rates may reduce evasion but could also diminish overall revenue, limiting resources for tax enforcement. This creates a paradox: while informal businesses might formalize, revenue losses could weaken the state’s ability to monitor compliance, risking a net negative fiscal impact. Countries like Malaysia reversed GST cuts after revenue declines hampered public spending.

5. **Market Distortions and Administrative Complexity:** Sector-specific GST cuts (e.g., green tech, housing) could skew market dynamics, fostering dependency on subsidies and inefficient resource allocation. Additionally, multi-tiered rates complicate tax administration, increasing costs for businesses and governments. The EU’s VAT system exemplifies how excessive rate differentiation fuels fraud and inefficiency.

6. **Unstimulative Fiscal Policy and Debt Burden:** GST cuts as stimulus are often less effective than direct spending (e.g., unemployment benefits, infrastructure projects), as high-income groups—who spend more on discretionary goods—benefit disproportionately. Meanwhile, revenue shortfalls may necessitate borrowing, escalating national debt. Post-2008, Greece’s VAT experiment exacerbated its debt crisis without sustaining consumption.

7. **False Globalization Advantage:** Lower GST may marginally reduce export costs but fails to address structural barriers like logistics inefficiencies or labor skill gaps. Competing nations can retaliate with similar cuts, nullifying advantages. Germany’s high VAT yet strong exports underscore that competitiveness hinges on productivity, not tax rates alone.

8. **Regressive Equity Outcomes:** GST reductions often disproportionately benefit wealthier households, who consume more taxable goods. Essential items (e.g., food, medicine) are already zero-rated in many regimes, meaning cuts primarily aid luxury spending. South Africa’s 2018 VAT increase exemptions for essentials proved more equitable than blanket cuts.

**Conclusion:** The GST 2025 reduction risks fiscal instability, inflationary pressure, and regressive outcomes while failing to address core economic challenges. Alternative solutions—like broadening the tax base, enhancing compliance technology, or targeted social spending—offer more sustainable paths to equity and growth.
