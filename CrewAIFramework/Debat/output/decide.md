The side arguing against the GST 2025 price reduction is more convincing based on the arguments presented. Despite compelling points from proponents—such as enhanced purchasing power, inflation control, and economic stimulation—the counterarguments demonstrate critical, systemic risks that outweigh these benefits.  

1. **Fiscal Sustainability:** The opposition convincingly highlights the risk of severe revenue shortfalls, citing IMF studies and cases like Malaysia’s GST reversal, where cuts led to unsustainable deficits and austerity measures. This undermines claims of long-term growth, as degraded public services (e.g., healthcare, education) would harm the very households the reduction aims to support.  

2. **Inflationary and Supply-Side Realities:** While proponents assert GST cuts lower prices, evidence from India’s 2017 GST rollout shows businesses often retained savings rather than passing them to consumers. The opposition’s warning of demand-pull inflation—if consumption outpaces supply—adds credible skepticism to the pro-inflation control argument.  

3. **Business Competitiveness Flaws:** The counterargument that GST reductions may disincentivize innovation (e.g., Brazil’s IPI tax cuts) weakens the pro-business growth narrative. Compliance burdens for MSMEs during rate changes further challenge the claim of simplified operations.  

4. **Regressive Outcomes:** Proponents argue GST cuts advance equity, but the opposition provides stronger evidence that essentials are often already zero-rated, making reductions regressive (e.g., South Africa’s targeted exemptions proved fairer). Wealthier households benefit disproportionately from luxury spending cuts, contradicting equity goals.  

5. **Ineffective Stimulus:** The opposition’s comparison of GST cuts to direct spending (e.g., Greece’s VAT experiment worsening debt without sustaining demand) demonstrates that such reductions are inferior fiscal tools. High-income groups gain more, undermining inclusive growth.  

6. **Structural Limitations:** Claims of global competitiveness via lower costs are refuted by examples like Germany, where high VAT coexists with strong exports. The opposition rightly emphasizes that logistics, skills, and productivity—not tax rates alone—drive competitiveness, rendering GST cuts ineffective for long-term gains.  

7. **Viable Alternatives:** The opposition’s proposed solutions—broadening the tax base, investing in compliance technology, and targeted social spending—offer more sustainable, equitable pathways without the risks of revenue collapse or market distortions from sector-specific cuts.  

In conclusion, the opposition’s reliance on empirical precedents, systemic risk analysis, and superior alternative strategies makes their case decisive. The pro-GST reduction arguments, while theoretically appealing, lack robust evidence to mitigate concerns about fiscal instability, inflationary traps, and regressive outcomes. Thus, the GST 2025 reduction is not a convincing policy tool for equitable or sustainable growth.
