**$100,000 Long-Term Investment Allocation**  
1. **NextEra Energy (NEE)** - $50,000 (50% allocation)  
   - Rationale: Undervalued at 27.5 P/E (-12% vs subsector), 59% renewable exposure, low regulatory risk with FERC pre-approved projects, and 6.2x interest coverage indicates strong debt health.  
   - Expected Returns: 12-18 month price target $90 (current price ~$72 implies 25% upside)  

2. **Iberdrola (IBE)** - $50,000 (50% allocation)  
   - Rationale: 70% clean energy mix with REPowerEU subsidies, 5.8 GW offshore wind pipeline, and digitalization potential driving 20% upside. More attractive P/E (16.0) than European peers.  

**Intraday Trading Recommendations (Based on Report Data)**  
- **Short Adani Green (ADANIGREEN)**: Extreme overvaluation (80.1 P/E) + $1.2B debt maturity risk  
- **Swing Trade Duke Energy (DUK)**: 5.1Â¢/kWh debt cost suggests volatility around rate case decisions  
- **Day Trade EDF**: High regulatory risk (4/5 rating) creates intraday price swings
